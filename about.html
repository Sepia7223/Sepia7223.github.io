                <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
                <p>At the start of the school year, we were tasked with an exciting challenge: to create a database and a website to showcase information about converting cars from fuel-powered to electric. We are a group of five, each with limited experience in website and database development, but we've embraced this opportunity to learn and grow together.</p>
                <p>Working as a team has had its ups and downs, but like every challenge in life, we have faced it with determination and a shared goal: to build the best website possible and, most importantly, to WIN.</p>
